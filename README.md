# OnboardKit

> A clean toolkit for onboarding (iOS & macOS)    

<img width="355" alt="img" src="https://s11.gifyu.com/images/SBlzV.gif">

## Overview

- OnboardKit is a comprehensive SwiftUI library designed to simplify the creation of onboarding experiences for iOS and macOS applications. 
- Supply your own page models with title, description and buttons. 
- Customize the sheet content with your own views. Sheets are prompted via button actions. Button actions can also trigger other actions you wish to add.

## Features

- üåô **Dark / Light Mode Support**
- üå´Ô∏è **Subdued Translucent Background** (app as background)
- üìã **Prompt Sheets via Button Actions** (from bottom for iOS, from top for macOS)
- ‚ûï **Add Custom Steps via Sheets** (great for additional onboarding customizations)
- üß© **Bring Your Own (BYO) Page Model** (easily create model via array of tuples)
- üì± **Multiplatform Support** (iOS and macOS - iPad / iPhone / Mac)
- ‚óÄÔ∏è‚ñ∂Ô∏è **Left / Right Chevron Buttons** (macOS expected UX)
- ü§ö **Panning Support for macOS** (navigate left / right)

## Structure:
- `OnboardContainer`: ZStack wrapper w/ app + onboard-cover
- `OnboardCover`: VStack w/ contet + bottom-nav-bar  
- `OnboardPage`: Title, description, action-buttons. And sheet binding
- `PageContainer`: The swipe-carusel 
- `NavView`: Continue-button, Skip-button and dots
- `ControlOverlay` Has Previous and next arrow buttons (macOS only)
- `OnboardModel`: Title, description and action

## Usage

Here is a basic example of how to set up OnboardKit in your SwiftUI application:

```swift
import SwiftUI
import OnboardKit

@main
struct MyAppIOSApp: App {
   var body: some Scene {
      WindowGroup {
         ContentView()
      }
   }
}
struct ContentView: View {
   @State var needsOnboarding: Bool = true
   var body: some View {
      OnboardContainer(needsOnboarding: $needsOnboarding) { (_ needsOnboarding: Binding<Bool>) in
         OnboardView(
            pageModels: OnboardModel.dummyModels, // point to your own onboarding models here
            onComplete: {
               needsOnboarding.wrappedValue = false
            }
         )
      } background: {
         ZStack {
            Rectangle() // this is where the app main view goes
               .fill(Color.init(light: Color.lightGray.lighter(amount: 0.8), dark: Color.darkGray.darker(amount: 0.8))) // light or dark mode
            Text("Your app goes here")
         }
         .frame(maxWidth: .infinity, maxHeight: .infinity)
         .edgesIgnoringSafeArea(.all)
      }
   }
}
```

## Installation

To integrate OnboardKit into your Xcode project using Swift Package Manager, add the following as a dependency to your `Package.swift`:

```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/sentryco/OnboardKit", branch: "main")
```
      
## Dependencies

OnboardKit utilizes these dependencies:

- Light and dark mode: [HybridColor](https://github.com/sentryco/HybridColor) 
- Page control for iOS: [PageControl](https://github.com/sentryco/PageControl) 
- Page controller for macOS: [PageControllerView](https://github.com/sentryco/PageControllerView) 
- Blur view support: [BlurView](https://github.com/sentryco/BlurView) 

## Multiplatform Support

OnboardKit seamlessly supports both iOS and macOS platforms, ensuring a consistent onboarding experience across devices. Platform-specific features include:

- **iOS**
   - Swipe navigation with `TabView`
   - Page control indicators
   - Sheets presented from the bottom
- **macOS**
   - Left/right chevron buttons for navigation
   - Panning support (navigate left/right)
   - Sheets presented from the top

## Design Philosophy

OnboardKit is built around a simple yet powerful model system. By supplying your own `OnboardModel` instances, each containing a `title`, `description`, and optional `actions`, you can quickly assemble a customized onboarding experience.

This approach allows you to:

- Easily define the content of each onboarding page.
- Attach custom actions to buttons, including presenting sheets or performing other tasks.
- Maintain a clean separation between your onboarding logic and UI components.

Here's an example of defining custom page models:

```swift
let pageModels: [OnboardModel] = [
   OnboardModel(
      title: "Welcome",
      description: "Explore the amazing features of our app.",
      actions: []
   ),
   OnboardModel(
      title: "Stay Informed",
      description: "Enable notifications to stay updated.",
      actions: [
            (
               buttonTitle: "Enable Notifications",
               action: { observableSheet in
                  // Handle enabling notifications
               }
            )
      ]
   ),
   OnboardModel(
      title: "Get Started",
      description: "Let's start your journey!",
      actions: []
   )
]
```

## Important Notes

When integrating OnboardKit, ensure that your main app view uses:

```swift
.frame(maxWidth: .infinity, maxHeight: .infinity)
.edgesIgnoringSafeArea(.all)
```

This ensures that the onboarding views cover the entire screen and layouts are handled correctly across different devices and orientations.

## TODO: 

- Clean up code ‚úÖ
- Add gif for macOS / iPad
- Add modal sheet example ‚úÖ
- Enable isTest in the scope of this package ‚úÖ
- Add high level doc regarding the simplistic approch with models that can have btns, title, decription, and popover sheet, and how this ultimatly makes making multipleplatform onbiarding a breeze, yet makes it possible to build powerful and complex onboarding experiences, while leaving the nitty gritty to this kit
- Add note regarding implemnting a lockable view with onboardview. How the structure will look etc, and link to the repo etc?
- Add a const struct that can be inject when initiating, that has variouse custom sizes etc
- Make some sort of style struct we can inject on init of onboardkit? ViewModifiers can be used with param drilliing etc
- Add access-id struct as well?
- Add demo xcodproj file like we do with SplitViewKit? üëà instead of having the dummy code in the preview etc
- Add PreviewContainer class üëà
- Bump spm package to 6.0 and iOS 18 and macOS 15 etc üëà
- Add note in readme about importance of using frame width max infinity and edgeIgnores... etc
- Add emojies to the features list. Use gpt
- Figure out how to offset dots for iOS ?
