 * This is the onboarding container for individual onboard pages
 * - Abstract: A view that shows a "welcome-message" to the user
 * - Description: This is the onboarding container for individual onboard pages. It manages the current index of the onboarding page being displayed, the array of page models for onboarding, and the callback for when onboarding completes. The onboarding API is fairly abstract / modular to support "what's new intro" in the future etc. It is also known as `OnboardContainerView`.
 * - Remark: The onboarding API is fairly abstract / modular to support "what's new intro" in the future etc
 * - Remark: We can use `.navigateForward` `.navigateBack` `.selectedViewController` `.navigateForward(to: 0)`
 * - Note: Alternative name: `OnboardContainerView`
